# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
The project was made for Introduction to Intelligent Systems course.

The project involves building and describing a complete general agent that operates in multiple
domains and carry on a variety of tasks in these domains. 
I used Q-learning technique and the planning code of pddlsim.

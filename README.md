# Reinforcement-Learning-Project
The project was made for "Introduction to Intelligent Systems" course.


## Introduction
The project involves building and describing a complete general agent that operates in multiple
domains and carry on a variety of tasks in these domains. 
I used Q-learning technique and the planning code of pddlsim. 

## Technologies
* Python

* PDDL

## Setup
To run the project with leran mode:
```
$ python my_executive.py -L <domain_file> <problem_file>
```

To run this project with execute mode:

```
$ python my_executive.py -E <domain_file> <problem_file>
```
